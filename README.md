This is my first project. I am 17 years old and have little to no coding experiance. I used chat GPT to come up help me make the idea, Model, Data, app, and website. It also tought me the basics of Python, VS code, Heroku, Github, and also how to use chatGPT in general to witch previously i have had no experienece using. this project is a vehicle classifirer that will look ant most types of image files and predict wheather it is a Sedan, SUV or Truck. this is the link to the website i made to use the app https://vehicle-classifier-c3f7ed58873f.herokuapp.com/
